When designing or working on deviated wells, it is essential to consider the hydraulics for well cleaning, evaluating various scenarios such as:
Hole stability and hole cleaning, rheological models, drill pipe eccentricity, flow and rotation speeds, fluid properties in hole cleaning, and how to clean the bottom of the well (hole).


## Tipos de pozos de alto ángulo

- Horizontal Wells.
- Extended Reach Wells.
- Holes with Angles Greater than 70º.

For the construction of high-angle wells, various aspects must be considered when designing the well, including:

- Hole Stability.
- Hole Cleaning.


## Hole Stability 

Well stability is a consequence of the physical and chemical characteristics of drilling fluids, along with the use of good drilling practices. Among the factors that can cause hole instability:

- Chemically. 
- Mechanically.  
- Both ways (Chemically and Mechanically).

**Chemical Instability:** This occurs when there is an incompatibility between the drilling fluid and the formation.

**Mechanical Instability:** It is caused by inadequate drilling fluid density, rock mechanics, excessive annular velocities, and ECD (Equivalent Circulating Density).


## Holes may experience failures due to compression or tension.

- **Hole Fracture:** Occurs when the pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the surrounding rocks.
- **Hole Collapse:** Occurs when hole pressures are too low, potentially exceeding the compressive strength of the surrounding rocks.

**"The density of the drilling fluid is a critical factor in controlling well stability."**


## Cuttings Transport

The cuttings transport mechanism varies in each section due to the nature of the cuttings beds. Two broad classifications of cuttings transport are:
 
- Suspension.
- Transport of cuttings beds.

As the well angle increases, larger cuttings migrate to the lower side of the well, while smaller cuttings move upward in heterogeneous suspension. In the vertical section, cuttings tend to mix with the drilling fluid, moving in homogeneous suspension until they exit the hole. At higher angles, cuttings tend to form cuttings beds and shift along the lower side of the well. Due to the combination of sliding beds, Boycott settling, and an asymmetric flow profile in the well section with a moderate angle, hole cleaning becomes more challenging.

The transport of cuttings from the bottom to the surface depends on two parameters: fluid and hydraulics.

**Hydraulics fulfill this function through:**  
 
- Pressure drops.  
- Annular velocity. 

**Fluids fulfill this function through:**
 
- Viscosity.  
- Density.  
- Yield point, n, k, tau 0.
