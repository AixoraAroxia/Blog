## Rheological Models

Rheological models are mathematical relationships that allow us to characterize the rheological nature of a fluid by studying the deformation given at a specific shear rate.

**Why is a rheological model necessary for drilling fluid?**
- It is needed to describe the fluid behavior across a wide spectrum of shear stress.
- Input parameters for hydraulic models for flow simulation inside the drill pipe and annular space.

## Concepts: 

It is the study of the physical principles governing the movement and deformation of matter when subjected to external stresses. It examines the relationship between stress and deformation in materials capable of flowing, defining flow as the continuous deformation generated by the application of a tangential force.

**Concepts:**

**Shear Stress(𝜏𝑖):** The fluid's resistance to the sliding movement of its layers when a force is applied tangentially to its laminar surface. It has units of force per area.

**Shear Rate (𝛾𝑖):** The difference between the velocities of two layers divided by the distance that separates them. It has units of velocity per length.

**Viscosity (𝜇):** The resistance a fluid offers to being deformed.

**“Part of the resistance to flow caused by mechanical friction is affected by the concentration of solids, the size, and the shape of solid particles.”**

## Tipos de fluidos en general

- Newtonian
- Non-Newtonian

## Newtonian Fluids

These are fluids with fixed viscosities that do not change due to shear stress or shear rate.

![Newtonian Fluids](./assets/posts/well-hydraulics-rheological-models/fluidos-newtonianos.webp)

## Non-Newtonian Fluids

Non-Newtonian fluids are fluids whose viscosity changes due to shear stress or shear rate.

**Types:**
- **Plastic Fluids (Bingham):** Constant viscosity with yield stress.
- **Dilatant Fluids:** Thicken with shear (variable viscosity with shear stress), like blood.
- **Pseudoplastics:** Thin with shear (variable viscosity with shear stress), like most drilling fluids, cement, and paints.

**Bingham Plastic Model**

This is a two-parameter model widely used in the industry. The defining:
    **𝜏 = 𝜏𝑦 + 𝜇𝑝 ∙ 𝛾** 

A Bingham Plastic fluid does not begin to flow until the applied shear stress exceeds the minimum value **𝜏𝑦**.

**Model Parameters:**
	1) Plastic Viscosity[mPV]
	2) Yield Point [tYP]

**Power Law** 

This is a two-parameter model in which absolute viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases. The relationship between shear rate and shear stress is given by: 
    **𝜏 = 𝐾𝛾 𝑛** 

There is no term for the yield point, so under this model, fluids start to flow at zero shear rate.

**Model Parameters:**
	1) Flow Behavior Index [n]
	2) Consistency Index [K]


**Casson Model** 

This model provides a good description of the rheological characteristics of drilling fluids. However, at high temperatures and low pressures, its approximation becomes less accurate.

The defining equation is:
    **𝜏 12 = 𝜏𝑦 12 + 𝜇 𝑝𝛾**

**Herschel–Bulkley Model**

This model combines theoretical and practical aspects of the Bingham Plastic and Power Law models.
**𝜏 = 𝜏 𝑦 + 𝐾𝛾 𝑛**

In this model, the parameters **“𝑛”** and **“𝑘”** are defined the same as in the Power Law. Special cases include the Bingham Plastic model when **𝑛=1** and the Power Law when **𝜏𝑦=0**.

**Model Parameters:**
	1) Flow Behavior Index[n]
	2) Consistency Index [K]
	3) Yield Stress [t0]

## Rheological Model Selection: 

To compare rheological models, we determine which one best fits experimental data by calculating the error for each and selecting the model with the minimum error.

![Ec %Error](./assets/posts/well-hydraulics-rheological-models/error.webp)

 Where **𝜏𝑖** is the measured shear rate, and **𝜏𝑖** is the shear rate calculated by the model at each point. The selected model will be the one whose **“%Error”** value is closest to zero.

## Equivalent Mud Weight (EMW or ESD) (lb/gal, SG, kg/m³)

Equivalent Static Density (ESD) is the pressure exerted by a column of static fluid at the bottom of the hole (or any TVD), expressed in terms of fluid density required to obtain an equivalent pressure at a given vertical depth.

**EMW = 0.052  x MW  x TVD**

Where:
**Density = Densidad del fluido, lb/gal**
**TVD = profundidad vertical verdadera, pies**

## Equivalent Circulating Density [ECD] (lb/gal, SG, kg/m³)

Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) is the pressure exerted at the bottom of the well by a fluid under dynamic conditions or circulation, considering cuttings transport and hydraulic losses in the wellbore.

![Ec ECD](./assets/posts/well-hydraulics-rheological-models/ecd-1.webp)

It can be calculated at any depth; this pressure is expressed in terms of the fluid density required to obtain an equivalent pressure at a given depth.

![Ec ECD](./assets/posts/well-hydraulics-rheological-models/ecd-2.webp)

The main variable in this equation is the annular pressure loss **∆P**.

**Factors Affecting ∆P in the Well:**
- Annular diameter
- Flow rate
- Drilling fluid properties
- Pipe rotation
- Formation pressures

**Surge Pressures** Surge pressures are observed when pulling the pipe out of the hole. They act in the opposite direction, and although they counteract ECD, they can also be harmful to a well since they contribute to fatigue stresses on the wellbore wall.

**The magnitude of these pressures depends on:**
- Pipe velocity
- Mud viscosity
- Flow through the area around the BHA or casing.
